# hello-world
My first project to get familar with GitHub.
I use a branch called Edit Hello World to make some changes. This way it will not contaminate the orginial program with bugs.
By the way, it's OmniCarlos here.
I am a big butt Banana with an untamed soul. I taste like risotto because I am OmniCarlos!
